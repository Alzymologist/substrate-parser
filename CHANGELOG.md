# v0.4.0

This is a major rehaul of crate. Older versions are going into deprecation soon, as they are desperately obsolete at this point.

Features:

- `no-std` compatibility
- External memory support to dynamically access metadata and call without full copy into memory space
- Shortened metadata support
- More sane short specs structure
- Properly parse unchecked extrinsics

Bug fixes:

- Multiple minor fixes in rarely used extrinsic structure
